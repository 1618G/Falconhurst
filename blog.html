                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <p>Robin Hoods Bay is one of the most picturesque villages on the Yorkshire Coast, and there's so much to explore. Here are our top recommendations:</p>
                            
                            <h3>1. Explore the Historic Village</h3>
                            <p>Wander through the maze of narrow cobbled streets and alleyways that wind down to the sea. The village has barely changed in centuries, with traditional fishermen's cottages clinging to the cliffside. Don't miss the old smugglers' tunnels that connect some of the buildings!</p>
                            
                            <h3>2. Rock Pooling at Low Tide</h3>
                            <p>The rocky shore at Robin Hoods Bay is one of the best spots for rock pooling in the UK. At low tide, you'll find crabs, starfish, anemones, and all manner of sea creatures. Perfect for families with children.</p>
                            
                            <h3>3. Fossil Hunting</h3>
                            <p>The bay is famous for its Jurassic fossils. After storms, you can find ammonites and other prehistoric treasures washed up on the beach. The rocks date back 180 million years!</p>
                            
                            <h3>4. Walk the Cinder Track</h3>
                            <p>This beautiful 7-mile trail follows the old railway line between Robin Hoods Bay and Whitby. It's flat, scenic, and perfect for walking or cycling. The views of the coastline are spectacular.</p>
                            
                            <h3>5. Visit the Old Coastguard Station</h3>
                            <p>Now a National Trust visitor centre, this building offers exhibitions about the local wildlife, geology, and maritime history. The views from here are stunning.</p>
                            
                            <h3>6. Fish and Chips by the Sea</h3>
                            <p>No trip to the Yorkshire coast is complete without fish and chips! The village has several excellent takeaways – grab your meal and eat it on the slipway watching the waves.</p>
                            
                            <h3>7. Visit the Robin Hood's Bay Museum</h3>
                            <p>This small but fascinating museum tells the story of the village's fishing and smuggling past. It's housed in a former chapel and is packed with local artefacts.</p>
                            
                            <h3>8. Pub Lunch at The Bay Hotel</h3>
                            <p>Right at the bottom of the village, The Bay Hotel offers great food and drink with unbeatable sea views. Perfect for warming up after a walk on the beach.</p>
                            
                            <h3>9. Photography Walk</h3>
                            <p>With its dramatic cliffs, traditional cottages, and ever-changing light, Robin Hoods Bay is a photographer's paradise. Sunrise and sunset are particularly magical times.</p>
                            
                            <h3>10. Simply Relax</h3>
                            <p>Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all. Sit on the beach, listen to the waves, and let the stresses of everyday life drift away. That's what holidays are for!</p>

                        <h2 class="blog-title">Coastal Walks from Robin Hoods Bay</h2>
                        <div class="blog-excerpt">
                            <p>The Yorkshire Coast offers some of the finest coastal walking in England. Here are our favourite routes starting from Robin Hoods Bay:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Robin Hoods Bay to Whitby (6 miles)</h3>
                            <p>This classic section of the Cleveland Way takes you along dramatic cliffs with stunning views. The path climbs up from the village, passes through farmland, and offers spectacular views of both Robin Hoods Bay and Whitby. Allow 3 hours one way, then catch the bus back or walk the Cinder Track for a circular route.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Cinder Track (7 miles)</h3>
                            <p>This flat, easy trail follows the old Scarborough to Whitby railway line. It's perfect for families, cyclists, and those who prefer gentler walking. Beautiful woodland sections and views of the coast. You can join it just outside the village.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Ravenscar Circuit (8 miles)</h3>
                            <p>Head south along the Cleveland Way to Ravenscar, the "town that never was." Visit the National Trust centre, explore the old alum works, and return via inland paths. Moderately challenging with some steep sections.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Boggle Hole Walk (2 miles round trip)</h3>
                            <p>A lovely short walk to the YHA at Boggle Hole, set in a secluded cove. The name comes from local folklore about a hobgoblin that lived in the caves. Perfect for families or a pre-dinner stroll.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Village Explorer (1-2 miles)</h3>
                            <p>Don't underestimate the village itself! Walking up and down the steep streets is quite a workout. Explore every alleyway, discover hidden gardens, and find the best viewpoints.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Walking Tips</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Wear sturdy footwear – paths can be muddy and uneven</li>
                                <li>Check tide times if walking on the beach</li>
                                <li>Bring layers – coastal weather is changeable</li>
                                <li>Carry water and snacks for longer walks</li>
                                <li>Dogs are welcome on most paths</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>We've been overwhelmed by the wonderful feedback from our recent guests, and we wanted to share some of their kind words.</p>
                            
                            <p>Opening a holiday let is always a leap of faith. You pour your heart and soul into creating a special space, but you never quite know how guests will respond. The feedback we've received has exceeded all our expectations.</p>
                            
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>"Falconhurst is a fantastic place to stay. Very spacious, beautifully decorated, and the sea views are wonderful. Cliff and Ann were incredibly welcoming hosts. We'll definitely be back!"</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>"Great accommodation, friendly hosts, good location. The apartment was clean, well-equipped and had everything we needed. The village is charming and the coastal walks are stunning."</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            
                            <p>What makes us most proud is when guests mention the little touches – the comprehensive information pack, the quality of the furnishings, and the thought that's gone into every detail.</p>
                            
                            <p>We've also loved hearing about the adventures our guests have had – from fossil hunting on the beach to completing the Cleveland Way, from exploring Whitby to simply relaxing in the lounge with a cup of tea and those wonderful sea views.</p>
                            
                            <p>Thank you to all our guests for your wonderful reviews. They mean the world to us!</p>
